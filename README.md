# Semantic Data Mining in Bioinformatics

This repository contains the project files and class materials for the "Semantic Data Mining" module in the Master of Bioinformatics program at the University of Murcia. The course explores the application of semantic web technologies to the life sciences, focusing on the creation, manipulation, and querying of biological knowledge graphs using RDF, SPARQL, and OWL.

## Course Overview

The "Semantic Data Mining" course is designed to equip students with the skills necessary to apply semantic web technologies in bioinformatics. The curriculum covers:

- **Life Sciences Semantic Web**: Introduction to semantic web architectures with a focus on their application in biology and biomedicine, including knowledge graphs and ontologies like Gene Ontology and Sequence Ontology.
- **Biological Knowledge Graphs**: Practical sessions on creating and querying semantic knowledge graphs using RDF and SPARQL in the context of bioinformatics.
- **Creation and Exploitation of Bio-Ontologies**: Use and creation of ontologies to add meaning to biological data, applying OWL for data inference, supporting functional data analysis.
- **FAIR Principles**: Understanding and implementing Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data principles through semantic technologies.

## Repository Structure

- `Lecture_Notes/`: Contains PDFs and PowerPoint files of the course lectures.
- `Project Antibody storage/`: Project files including RDF datasets, OWL ontology files, and SPARQL query examples.

### Featured Projects

One notable project involves creating an RDF dataset of commercial antibodies. This dataset integrates various external databases, facilitating efficient search and retrieval of antibody information for experimental use. This helps optimize budget and storage space in laboratories by allowing researchers to identify and utilize antibodies that are already available within their or collaborating institutions.

### Technologies Used

- **Protégé**: For ontology development and management.
- **Blazegraph**: As a triplestore for storing and querying RDF data.
- **SPARQL**: Used for querying RDF data, integrating data across diverse biological databases.
